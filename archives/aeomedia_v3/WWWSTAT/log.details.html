<P>This report keeps track of &quot;user sessions,&quot; showing the paths taken through the site by its visitors. It also provides an estimate of how many unique visitors the site has had and how long they've stayed. Please note, however, that precise tracking of the number of visitors is impossible; the information in this report is at best a reasonably close approximation based on the information in the server access log.
